# LowCost Air Monitor 🌍

LowCost Air Monitor is an open-source, low-cost air quality monitoring
system designed for rural and industrial fringe areas where traditional
air monitoring stations are unavailable or too expensive.

The project focuses on affordability, scalability, and ease of deployment
while providing meaningful air pollution data for awareness and decision-making.

---

## Why this project?

Air pollution monitoring infrastructure is often limited to urban areas
due to the high cost of regulatory-grade monitoring stations. Rural and
industrial fringe regions remain largely unmonitored despite facing
significant air quality challenges.

This project aims to bridge that gap using low-cost sensors, IoT
technology, and open data principles.

## What does it monitor?

- PM2.5 (Fine particulate matter)
- PM10 (optional)
- Temperature & humidity (future scope)

PM2.5 is the primary focus due to its strong impact on human health.
